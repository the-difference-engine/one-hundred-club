  {title: "2016 Memorial Day Homily", content: "By Chicago Fire Department Chaplain Fr. Thomas Mulcrone\r\nOn many Tuesday nights anywhere from 7 to 9 million people sink into their favorite chair, set their TV to NBC, and begin to watch the television program, Chicago Fire.” I suspect there are many in this church today who can count themselves among those very dedicated viewers. Me? I rearrange my sock drawer on Tuesday nights, instead. But I do know for those millions who have their eyes glued to the big screen TV on Tuesday night Chicago Fire is their reality – they believe this is what the fire service in general, and the Chicago Fire Department in particular, is all about. Too bad those same millions couldn’t be here this morning to experience what it really means to be a member of the fire service and, more importantly, the CFD.\r\nThe reality is that we have come together today in this magnificent church to remember your husband and wives, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, your co-workers, brothers and sisters in this noble profession, who lived and served with unwavering dedication and honor. We’re here with our flags, our Honor Guard, with the Pipes and Drums, with the uniformed members of this great Department, because for the past 84 years the CFD has gathered on Memorial Day to show honor and respect for those of our family that have fallen. We surround ourselves with the tradition bound symbols of our profession that taken together, represent the courageous and proud service that our brothers and sister have rendered.\r\nThe Honor Guard has already proudly displayed the symbols of loyalty, discipline, and patriotism while the dedicated members of this Department marched proudly in honor of your loved ones. The mournful and sultry tones of our bagpipers bring dignity to this celebration, while the drums tap and pound in cadence. A bell will toll as we read the names of these brave one whom we honor, signally the final shift of our fallen. Later on, we will lower the colors of our nation to show respect and remind ourselves that a grateful country remembers the service of all who have sworn an oath to protect and defend.\r\nThese traditions are not just symbols used as part of a ritual to honor those we lost…these traditions are part of who your loved one were, the core of their very character, expressing the breadth of their life’s values. This was their reality. This is how they lived their lives. And we do not forget.\r\nAs their names are read we will remember them for their great deeds. They saved lives in spite of the great dangers they faced in the performance of their duties. They were tenacious with strong character. They had larger than life personalities and lived their lives with passion. Giving of themselves and giving back were simply a way of life for them.\r\nThey loved this “job” and were willing to put their lives in each others hands…they had each other’s backs. That meant that once the speaker cracked or the tones sounded they were all in this together. That is the bond they shared…and it is what brings us here today. That is our reality this morning.\r\nAnd it is no mistake that we gather here at Holy Family Church to share our faith in the Lord and to be strengthened by his Word and sustained at his altar. St. Paul, writing in a letter to the struggling church in Rome, reminds these new Christians that the reality of their new found faith is found in giving themselves over to the Lord and trusting in His protection. And it is the Lord’s own words, recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, that remind all of us of what that giving of ourselves truly means…that when we do it for the least among us we do it for God. That is the sacredness of this great calling to be firefighters and paramedics. That is what those whom we honor today spent a lifetime doing – good work, real work, God’s work. That is why they are counted among the saints and angels in heaven.\r\nFinally, I’d like to share with you the words of a firefighter that hopefully puts this into perspective. In 1982 Chicago author Studs Terkel wrote the book, Working. It is a collection of interviews, oral history actually, about people and the work they do. The final chapter of the book is an interview with a New York firefighter by the name of Tom Patrick. The book closes with the words of this firefighter:\r\n“Last month there was a second alarm. I was off duty. I ran over there. I’m a bystander. I see these firemen on the roof with the smoke pouring out around them, and the flames, and they go in. It fascinated me. That’s what I do! I was fascinated by the people’s faces. You could see the pride they were seein’. The world’s so messed up, the country’s messed up. But the firemen, you actually see them produce. You see them put out a fire. You see them come out with babies in their hands. You see them give mouth-to-mouth when a guy’s dying. You can’t get over that. That’s real. To me, that’s what I want to be. \r\nI worked in a bank. You know, it’s just paper. It’s not real. Nine to five and its junk. You’re lookin’ at numbers. But I can look back and say, ‘I helped put out a fire. I helped save someone. It shows something I did on the earth.’”\r\nIt doesn’t get any more real than that.", image: nil, link: ""},

Prendergast of the Chicago Fire Department was on duty working his regular assignment with Engine 78. It was an ordinary work day, and Engine 78 responded to only three alarms prior to 10:00 PM. At approximately 9:53 PM, Engine 78 responded to a still and box alarm (followed by a 2-11 alarm) on North Kenmore Avenue.\nUpon Engine 78’s arrival, Prendergast was ordered to lead out a 2 ½” hose line to the rear of the building. Prendergast assisted in stretching and dragging the 2 ½” line to the seat of the fire. Later, as he was manning the 2 ½” line with a 1 ¼” nozzle by himself, Prendergast suffered chest pains and shortness of breath.\nPrendergast called out for help, grabbed his chest, bent over and appeared to be gasping for air. A battalion chief walked Prendergast over to Ambulance 31, where he again grabbed his chest, bent over and gasped for air. He was treated by paramedics and then transported to Illinois Masonic Hospital. Ambulance 31 arrived at Illinois Masonic’s Emergency Room at 10:53 hours. Prendergast was released to the emergency room personnel, and was treated, stabilized and admitted to the intensive coronary care unit where he remained for six days.\nOn July 29, 1998, Prendergast was released from the hospital with the understanding that he would be back at a later date and have coronary artery bypass surgery performed. Prendergast was convalescing at home, when, on August 4, 1998, he was stricken with another heart attack.

Kaczka of Engine 28 of the Chicago Fire Department died in the line of duty while fighting a refuse fire on S. Laflin Avenue. At 8:15PM, Engine 28 received the alarm from the main fire alarm office and, when they arrived at the scene, the firefighters were confronted with a very large pile of burning rubbish. Kaczka drove the engine into the fire area and positioned the engine in the location that was considered to be the best vantage point for attacking the fire.\n\nKaczka assisted with a number of these tasks, helping to pull the dry four inch hose line that was initially connected to the faulty hydrant. He also helped move the waterlogged line when the engine was backed up and repositioned, and then dragged the waterlogged line to the engine’s new position.

Above the parts room was a cockloft (unfinished area below the roof), where tires, Christmas decorations, and miscellaneous items were stored (believed to be the area of origin of the fire).\n\nFirefighter Patrick King responded with Truck 45.

None of the firefighters reported seeing any fire or smoke, so one of the firefighters radioed back to dispatch to verify the address. The address was confirmed by dispatch, and at the same time a neighbor told the firefighters he saw fire at the rear of the building.\n\nAt approximately 10:30 PM, the owner of the business arrived to unlock the front door to the showroom. Approximately 8 to 10 firefighters from the first-arriving companies, including King and Lockhart, entered the showroom; some firefighters reported no smoke showing, others reported observing a light haze in the showroom, with the odor of a burning car. They opened the door to the service area, where black smoke covering the top one-third of ceiling space was encountered. They entered with a charged 1 3/4-inch hose line, which was connected to a 2 1/2-inch leadout line. The firefighters indicated that at no time did any them feel any excessive heat or see any fire.\n\nAt approximately 10:43 PM, the 8 to 10 firefighters and officers who were inside the building had advanced some 15 to 20 feet into the service area where thick black smoke was above them.  At approximately 10:45 PM, without warning, hot gases that had accumulated along the 20- foot-high ceiling ignited, causing a backdraft situation. This created a pressure wave, knocking the firefighters off balance and to the floor. The firefighters became disoriented, could not find the hose, and were scrambling and yelling in an attempt to escape the inferno they had been caught in. Additionally, the molten polystyrene insulation from the ceiling area began falling down on them. One firefighter later reported that he could hear his fellow firefighters running into and knocking over things, yelling, and screaming, trying to escape from the burning structure. One firefighter dove through the office window to escape the burning building. The escape from the service area was complicated by the 20 cars stored in the service area, the intense heat, heavy black smoke, disorientation and panic from being trapped.\n\nWhen the firefighters exited the burning structure, an immediate head count was taken, and it was discovered that King and Lockhart were missing. Rescue attempts by firefighters to reenter the structure were numerous but futile, as the entire service area became fully involved with fire, prohibiting entry and rescue the missing fire fighters. Within 30 minutes, the entire truss roof collapsed into the structure. Once the fire was extinguished, King and Lockhart were removed from the scene and transported to Little Company of Mary’s Hospital Emergency Room by Ambulance 27 and Ambulance 17.

The address was confirmed by dispatch, and at the same time a neighbor told the firefighters he saw fire at the rear of the building.\n\nAt approximately 10:30 PM, the owner of the business arrived to unlock the front door to the showroom. Approximately 8 to 10 firefighters from the first-arriving companies, including King and Lockhart, entered the showroom; some firefighters reported no smoke showing, others reported observing a light haze in the showroom, with the odor of a burning car. They opened the door to the service area, where black smoke covering the top one-third of ceiling space was encountered. They entered with a charged 1 3/4-inch hose line, which was connected to a 2 1/2-inch leadout line. The firefighters indicated that at no time did any them feel any excessive heat or see any fire.\n\nAt approximately 10:43 PM, the 8 to 10 firefighters and officers who were inside the building had advanced some 15 to 20 feet into the service area where thick black smoke was above them.  At approximately 10:45 PM, without warning, hot gases that had accumulated along the 20- foot-high ceiling ignited, causing a backdraft situation. This created a pressure wave, knocking the firefighters off balance and to the floor. The firefighters became disoriented, could not find the hose, and were scrambling and yelling in an attempt to escape the inferno they had been caught in. Additionally, the molten polystyrene insulation from the ceiling area began falling down on them. One firefighter later reported that he could hear his fellow firefighters running into and knocking over things, yelling, and screaming, trying to escape from the burning structure. One firefighter dove through the office window to escape the burning building. The escape from the service area was complicated by the 20 cars stored in the service area, the intense heat, heavy black smoke, disorientation and panic from being trapped.\n\nWhen the firefighters exited the burning structure, an immediate head count was taken, and it was discovered that King and Lockhart were missing. Rescue attempts by firefighters to reenter the structure were numerous but futile, as the entire service area became fully involved with fire, prohibiting entry and rescue the missing fire fighters. Within 30 minutes, the entire truss roof collapsed into the structure. Once the fire was extinguished, King and Lockhart were removed from the scene and transported to Little Company of Mary’s Hospital Emergency Room by Ambulance 27 and Ambulance 17.

Bonnar, Sr., of the Orland Fire Protection District suffered a fatal heart attack in the line of duty following a training exercise.\nBonnar joined four other firefighters for an annual consumption test that measured how much air each firefighter consumed while wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus. The test simulated firefighting activities by requiring firefighters to complete an obstacle course while wearing full bunker gear, and the test also checked each firefighter’s blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. Bonnar completed the obstacle course in less than an hour, and was recovering from the exercise when he received a message on his pager, prompting him to leave the training area to use the cellular telephone in his car. Approximately twenty-five minutes later, another firefighter found Bonnar unconscious in his car. The firefighters, who were also certified paramedics, began advanced life support immediately, and Bonnar was transported to the hospital. Efforts to revive him in the field and at the hospital were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead from a heart attack.\nBonnar joined the Orland Fire Protection District as a volunteer in 1972. He soon became an emergency medical technician, enrolled in the first paramedic course at Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey, Illinois, and joined the Chicago Fire Department as a paramedic in 1974. In 1977, Bonnar was among the first full-time firefighter/paramedics hired by the Orland Fire Protection District.\nThree years later, firefighters from the Orland Fire Protection District joined the International Association of Fire Fighters as Local 2754, and Bonnar was elected as the union’s first president.
